(** This module defines the abstract syntax of the surface language. *)

(* In principle, very little desugaring is performed on the fly by the
   parser. *)

(* Field names are just variable names. These two namespaces cannot be
   statically distinguished (due to the possibility of punning). *)

module Field =
  Variable

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Information about data constructors. *)

(* Data constructor definitions should be viewed as generative. That is, when
   a type definition [data t = T { ... }] is processed, a ``fresh'' data
   constructor information record is internally created, to which the name [T]
   becomes bound. If we later process the type definition [data u = T { ... }],
   then a second information record is internally created, to which the name
   [T] now becomes bound. Thus, at this point, we have two logically distinct
   data constructors, only one of which can be referred to by name. *)

(* A data constructor information record could in principle contain a unique
   identifier; it doesn't, because we don't need it. Physical equality of
   data constructor information records gives us a meaningful notion of
   equality. *)

(* We maintain the following information about every data constructor. *)

type datacon_info = {
  (* Its unqualified name (used e.g. by [Interpreter.print_value]). *)
  datacon_name: string;
  (* Its arity (i.e., number of fields). *)
  datacon_arity: int;
  (* Its integer index within its data type definition. *)
  datacon_index: int;
  (* A map of field names to field indices. *)
  datacon_fields: int Field.Map.t;
  (* Its flavor (i.e. is it mutable or immutable). Currently the surface syntax
   * only allows us to define mutability per-datatype: we use the same value for
   * all branches. *)
  datacon_flavor: DataTypeFlavor.flavor;
}

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Provided we have the name of a data constructor, its index, and the ordered
   list of its fields, we can create a [datacon_info] record. *)

  datacon_name = Datacon.print dc;

}

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* A name can be either unqualified, [x], or qualified with a module name,
   [m::x]. This holds for variables (of arbitrary kind: term, type, etc.)
   and for data constructors. *)

type 'a maybe_qualified =
  | Unqualified of 'a
  | Qualified of Module.name * 'a

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* References to data constructors. *)

(* In the surface syntax, a reference to a data constructor is just a
   (possibly qualified) name. This is what the parser produces. When the
   type-checker runs, it augments this information with a pointer to the
   [datacon_info] record that this reference denotes. This later allows the
   compiler to work with an unambiguous syntax. *)

     field is not initialized by the parser; it is later filled in
     by the type-checker, which explains why it is a mutable option. *)
