(* Syntactic categories of names. *)

(* Term variables, type variables, type constructors, and fields are not
   syntactically distinguished. Placing term variables, type variables, and
   type constructors within a single syntactic category is natural because
   they share certain mechanisms (e.g. types and terms can be abstracted over
   them). They will be distinguished using sorts. Placing term variables and
   fields within a single syntactic category is required because we wish to
   allow puns. *)

   means that parentheses will sometimes be necessary (e.g. when a conjunction
   of permissions is used as an argument in a type application). Even worse,
   COMMA is used in the syntax of tuples, and this leads to conflicts with
   tuple types and multi-argument function types. So, I give up and use a
   dedicated symbol, STAR, for conjunction. Somewhat analogously, yet another
   symbol, BAR, is now used for the conjunction of a type and a permission. *)
