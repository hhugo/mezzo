(* A local identifier (one that is defined in the current module) is represented
   as a de Bruijn level (not to be confused with a de Bruijn index!). This is an
   implementation detail of [KindCheck] and does not affect its clients. *)

type level =
    int

(* An external identifier (one that is defined in another module) is represented
   as a value of type ['v]. Think of it as a binder that has been opened already. *)

(* Thus, for our purposes, a [var] is either a local name or a non-local name. *)

(* There is a subtlety concerning the meaning of the integer argument carried
   by [Local]. Internally, an environment contains [var]s represented using
   de Bruijn levels. However, the public functions that export variables,
   namely [find_variable] and [find_datacon], produce [var]s represented using de
   Bruijn indices. *)

(* A variable bound by little-lambda is viewed both as a term variable (i.e. it
   can occur within an expression) and as a type variable (i.e. it can occur
   within a type, and has kind [KTerm]). On the other hand, a variable bound by
   capital-Lambda is only a type variable -- it cannot be used at an [EVar] node.
   This ensures that types can be erased. In order to impose this restriction,
   we map each variable to a ``variety''. Note that we could perhaps instead
   encode this distinction into the kinds, by distinguishing [KRealTerm] and
   [KTerm]. The former would be a sub-kind of the latter. *)
